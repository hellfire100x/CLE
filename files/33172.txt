Hello Koken-Team,

there seems to be a strange displaying error with the essays. I can only have a specific number of pictures in an essay. If it is to much (in this case more than 21 pictures), nothing gets displayed and it seems like the code is broken. This happens with every theme. This also happens with essay.lens AND essays.lens.

Check this for example:

All images displayed: 
http://travelographer.de/essays/2013/07/whalewatching-auf-den-azoren-ii/

No images displayed, and it displays the image title "Essays - Travelographer" on top of the page: 
http://travelographer.de/essays/

For essay.lens I helped myself with splitting essays into "chapters" but this doesn't help with essays.lens of course.

Does this happen to other people as well?

Thanks in advance,
Sebastian

Sebastian – Each image requires an API call to get its info, and on some servers this can cause problems. We’re looking at a better way to handle this in a future release.

Thank you very much. I was guessing something like that already. Might as well explain some displaying errors while building up image previews in the backend.
